      <h1>Coexistence for Humans and AI</h1>
      <img src="images/alphago.jpg" alt="AlphaGo JPG" title=" AlphaGo beat Ke Jie "/>
      <p>We are now in an amazing ageï¼ŒAI (artificial intelligence) is dramatically changing our world. The implementation of AI will bring tremendous wealth, unprecedented wealth: 16 trillion dollars, according to PwC, in terms of added GDP to the worldwide GDP by 2030. It will also bring immense challenges in terms of potential job replacements. Whereas in the Industrial Age it created more jobs because craftsman jobs were being decomposed into jobs in the assembly line, so more jobs were created. And it's not just in factories, but truckers, drivers and even jobs like telesales, customer service and hematologists as well as radiologists over the next 15 years are going to be gradually replaced by artificial intelligence.</p>
	  <h2>So how do we differentiate ourselves as humans in the age of AI?</h2>
      <p>Really AI is taking away a lot of routine jobs, but routine jobs are not what we're about. Why we exist is love. When we hold our newborn baby, love at first sight, or when we help someone in need, humans are uniquely able to give and receive love, and that's what differentiates us from AI. When AlphaGo defeated the world champion Ke Jie, while Ke Jie was crying and loving the game of go, AlphaGo felt no happiness from winning and certainly no desire to hug a loved one. </p>
      <p>Compassion, love, or empathy are things that AI cannot do. So as AI takes away the routine jobs, I like to think we can, we should and we must create jobs of compassion. You might ask how many of those there are, but I would ask you: Do you not think that we are going to need a lot of social workers to help us make this transition? Do you not think we need a lot of compassionate caregivers to give more medical care to more people? Do you not think we're going to need 10 times more teachers to help our children find their way to survive and thrive in this brave new world?</p>
      
	  <h2>A blueprint of coexistence for humans and AI</h2>
	  <p>AI will come and take away the routine jobs and in due time, we will be thankful.  AI will work with humans as analytical tools that humans can wrap their warmth around for the high-compassion jobs. And we can always differentiate ourselves with the uniquely capable jobs that are both compassionate and creative, using and leveraging our irreplaceable brains and hearts. So there you have it: a blueprint of coexistence for humans and AI. It comes to free us from our regular work, and it comes to remind us of what makes us human. So let's choose to embrace AI and love each other.</p>
