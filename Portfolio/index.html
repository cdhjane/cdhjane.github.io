     <h1>About Me</h1>

	  <p>
	   I came from a very ordinary coastal city in China, which is certainly far from archaic but still not totally open-minded. I grew up in such an environment where tradition and modernization blended, and it shaped my diverse personality from all aspects. After four years of undergraduate studies in the United States, accompanied by the improvement of my personal academic ability, the comprehensiveness of my cognition of the world has been significantly broaden. I have come into contact with assortment of liberal ideas, and fundamentally shaped my outlook on life. As I came to realize what I am capable of, there are two core lifelong pursuits of mine: striving for the joy stemmed from great games and creating meaningful stories. Game can always make me feel a “clarity” of joy, which cannot be paralleled by any other type of entertainment. Game world is full of unknowns and uncertainties, but as long as the players still think they have a chance to get what they want from the game, that joy will never fade. I wish to give my efforts to make a game that can continue to provide players with certain joy. In other words, I want to give everyone the happiness that they can get at the press of a button. I will devote all my beautiful fantasies and personal emotions into my game and turn it into a thought-provoking story. As a fanatic who loves to create stories, my creative inspiration can always be ignited by the various things experienced by all kinds of people in life, and the self-perpetuating desire to frame more stories originated as my nostalgia for beautiful things and sympathy in regard to poor souls. Depicting joy and misery in an artistic way may not directly change the public, but it is likely to allow people to appreciate the necessity of more progressive ideas, and ultimately my story may ameliorate some maladies among our society.If someone is caught by my game and suddenly feels a strong sense of compassion and justice at a certain moment, or even feels regret and admiration for the fate of a certain game character I have created, my efforts shall truly mean something.

	   Furthermore, I adore cultural diversity. The blending of different cultures is truly fascinating. In the process, we comprehend each other better and establish intimate connection. This is a feasible path towards a brilliant future. On this basis, my short-term career goal is to become a game developer or game designer. My long-term career goal is to become an electronic artist who can provide high-quality entertainment for everyone, showing a world worthy of being loved by people in a virtual way, letting the audience or players feel the incredible possibilities of human beings, the beauty of difference, and all kinds of complex emotions.
