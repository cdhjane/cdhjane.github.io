    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="images/me.jpg" alt="Headshot jpg" title="My headshot">
  
    <p>I am a junior student at the Pennsylvania State University majoring in Design and Development Option in the College of Information Sciences and Technology and I am now looking for a position as a software development engineer. Based on my academic reserves and various aspects of growth during my college years, I personally believe that I have the ability to contribute talents and create business value to the company.</p>
    
    <p>As a newcomer in the computer industry, I learned the importance of engineering development experience to a programmer in the first class after choosing this major. During these three years of study, I have continuously carried out a variety of practices in order to enrich my experience, and at the same time, I have actively learned skills and specifications from more experienced senior programmers.Penn State University offers a lot of practical-oriented courses, which has laid a good foundation for me to improve my programming level. 
    </p> 
	<p> What I am most proud of and benefit from is that I led the team members to complete the prototype of a Java-based medical information management system. I learned how a professional software development team can complete a system project with a very low error rate under precise teamwork and task arrangements. My understanding of the entire development process is enough to support me through the adaptation period of this job quickly. I am very confident to put what I have learned into practice in my future work.
	</p>
    <p>I am looking forward to an opportunity for a full time internship in the field of Information Technology for the summer 2020 term to gain more valuable experience for a successful career after my graduation.</p>
    <p> Iâ€™ve also attached my resume for download for a closer look at my background:<a href="ChatBot.zip" download="ChatBot.zip">Source Code</a>
