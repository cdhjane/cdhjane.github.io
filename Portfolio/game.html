	   <h1>Individual Game Design</h1>
	   </p>
	   <b>Fragile</b> is an action-adventure game played from third-person perspective.Player acts as one of three manipulable characters with completely different positions and identities. They act for their beliefs and pursuits in a dystopian world created by those with supernatural powers among ordinary human, advancing the main story and eventually reaching different endings through desperate struggles with rivals and choices made in special events.

	   <h2 style="color: blue;">Gameplay</h2> 
	   <pre id="game_block1">
       At the beginning of a new game, players need to choose one of the three controllable figures to create a new game save, while updating it during the non-combat process of the game at any time. The other two characters that are not selected will become parts of many non-player characters, but they will make different choices in each major incident as important roles that hold the integrated direction of the story, just like what the player does.  This is equivalent to three main characters dominating the evolution of the story. Players only manipulate one of them, but they can also play the other two core roles in the new game. The decisions made by the two uncontrolled characters will be interfered by the player’s actions, but there is also a certain degree of randomness under inevitable circumstances, which leads to different results when two identical decisions are made in an event. This just represents their behavior as controllable characters based entirely on the player's personal will. In addition, other non-player characters will act according to a fixed setting, and make different but established behaviors based on the story direction determined by the three core characters.
	   
	   The game underlines the interaction between people. There is no "pawn" that can respawn indefinitely or "BOSS" guarding a certain region. The enemies the player faces in each battle are those living people in the story. Their survival, death, injury or retreat after fighting with the player will lead to distinct outcomes. The same goes for the interplay between players and non-hostile NPCs. Time within the game will flow at the speed of the real world, and a predetermined event will be forced to occur at a specific point. Simultaneously, players have a given amount of free time for exploring various collection elements or unlocking hidden plots, and they can even start off a new story line due to the key choices made during unrestrained exploration. The various areas in the game world are directly connected, but in most cases where the player has been located is determined by the progress of the story itself. In a nutshell, all the elements of the game are completely dominated by the plot and follow the logic of the normal development of time and space. There is no going back, nothing to do or the progress of the story is completely stalled.
	   
	   The death mechanic will be applied to maintain the rationality of the game plot. Except for dying in battle, any situation that violates the basic rules will be prevented by the game’s own death punishment, such as requiring the player to sneak through a certain area within a predetermined time and the player failing to complete the task, which directly leads to a game over after a battle that has no chance of winning; or a failing rescue for a figure who died due to the player’s slack on the task. The player will be bound to death in the next battle due to the lack of important information offered by this character. Players can try to resist in battles that are bound to be defeated, however, they will eventually die due to the mechanics of the game itself. Different types of death results will be notified to players in different forms on the death settlement page. If the player is defeated in a battle that can be won, the settlement page will show what kind of error has been made during the battle that led to death; conversely, if the player has fallen into a doomed situation owing to improper handling of a previous event, player will be informed of the external reasons why this battle is destined to fail. On the other hand, the player’s negative behavior in normal combat will also be punished by death that cannot be escaped, such as deliberately delaying the battle time, trying to escape when the enemy must be faced, or destroying the scene as the main purpose. In such situations the player's character will soon be killed. Regardless of the death ending, the player can choose to restart the game at a certain time before death in the settlement interface, or justload the archive.

	   <pre id="game_block2">
	   "Fragile" will present players a tight-paced combat experience with many uncertain factors. The characters that can be manipulated by the player are all humans with mysterious power called <b>"Messengers"</b>. According to the story setting, messengers can consume a kind of mental energy called <b>"Dreamland Capacity"</b>, so as to achieve some miracles that exceed the limit of human physical ability or even contrary to humans' normal cognition of the world. Just as humans use tools of different shapes to complete diverse tasks, messengers will visualize their dreamland capacity in the real world and sculpt them into shapes that are amiable to achieve a certain purpose. The dreamland capacity that has been given a shape is called the <b>"Plastid"</b>. It is a translucent substance with properties between entity and spirit. It will wrap or surround the messenger as its owner along with being manipulated by messenger's limbs and thoughts. There are various types of plastids, such as the limbs of various ferocious monsters, sharp cold weapons, formidable hot weapons, the catalyst of a certain disaster, a collection of notions in fairy tales or heroic deeds, or even some abnormal beings formed by chaotic concepts. The battle in this game takes place when messengers use their plastids to directly or indirectly attack each other. The three controllable characters have their own three different types of plastid options, a total of 9 types of plastids for players to utilize during the game. Players need to choose plastid for the figure they play when creating a new game, and it cannot be replaced in the subsequent game flow. The abilities of each plastids are diverse and unique. They are not limited to conventional attacks such as swinging weapons and claws or shooting ammunition. In some cases, they can distort space and time, create matters, enforce things that do not originally possess that nature, even directly rewrite the causal relationship, etc.
	  
       The combat of this game focuses on the collision among attack vectors and the significance of strategy in the fierce battle. Dreamland capacity is applied as the power origin for player and the enemy in the game to antagonize each other. It will be expended in the process of employing the plastid to perform various charged attacks or parry the enemy's attacks, and it cannot be fully restored to the maximum during the battle. When the character's body is directly injured, his/her dreamland capacity will be greatly depleted, directly causing an obvious disadvantage in the battle. Once the vital part of the body is fatally attacked, the dream volume will be cleared straightway, leading to the death of the character (player cannot continue to consume dreamland capacity when its value drops to a nonzero limit, but will soon be slaughtered by the opponent). On the other hand, once the amount of the remaining dreamland capacity is few, the plastids will gradually fail to maintain its original performance, and eventually disappear before the dream volume is exhausted. This refers that in majority bouts of a battle, player's and enemy’s assault will not directly hit each other’s torso, but will numerously collide with the opponent’s attack, until one side loses its posture and been stabbed right into the heart.
	  
	   During the battle, the character in the third-person perspective will always face the enemy. Any kind of attack will be classified base on eight directions of the screen and "straight/curve". This classification is also applicable to enemy attacks. And the player will be notified the enemy's attack direction through the phantom that briefly appears on the screen before the enemy's attack hits. Players can switch to passive defense mode when responding to the enemy's attack. Just input the correct direction at right moment (push the right joystick or move the mouse), and the character will block the enemy's attack in the best way. However, frequent use of passive defense will lead to sudden decrease in the value of the dreamland capacity, inevitably putting the player at disadvantage. It is only suitable for player to stabilize the situation during the fierce battle. The game mechanism encourages players to take the initiative to attack, by constantly switching the attack mode to complete gorgeous combos, suppressing the enemies' movements until crushing them; or grasping the enemy's weakness in the process of defense to complete a deadly counterattack. The attack mode menu will be displayed semi-transparently around the edge of the screen. Players use a common second set of movement control schemes (push right joystick or shift the mouse) to select the direction of the current attack action, and use other keys to switch between "straight/curve" or "melee/ranged/concept" categories of attack mode menu. The attack mode that the player is being able choose will change due to the current character's state. For example, when the player is under attack, he cannot perform many moves, and when jumping or rushing forward, he will have additional attack actions that are only available under such situations. At the same time, in a battle, players can enter the "tactical mode" to a limited extent. In the "tactical mode", the time in the game is paused, and the player consumes "tactical time", being able to clearly observe the current state of the enemy, having moment to plan the next action of the character. When the tactical mode is terminated, the character will automatically execute the actions set by the player when the game is paused, until all actions are completed or interrupted by the player's input of other instructions in midway.
	   
	   All sorts of attacks in the game have their own strength and attributes, which determine their effects when they hit the enemy. By consuming the dream volume and charging the upcoming attack action, player can achieve better results when hitting the enemy, such as damaging the opponent plastid and make them losing more dreamland capacity, but there is also a possibility of being suppressed by more powerful attack or being parried by defensive action. The charge of dreamland capacity is divided into three levels, which are determined by the number of times the player clicks the recharge button. The higher the charge level, the better the attack effect along with more intense power consumption. Players will directly enter the ultimate skill menu by clicking the charge button four times, employing powerful moves that can directly end the battle. Ultimate skills are often used as the final means of a duel, performing poorly when the enemy is in excellent condition and consuming a lot of dream volume. This requires players to make decisions wisely.

      <pre id="game_block3">	
      <label style="font-size:24px; font-weight:900">Plot</label>	  
	  The story takes place in a dystopian world that is transitioning to a modern industrial civilization and has fantasy elements. At the top of the food chain, there are a special human race called "messengers" with supernatural abilities. They can overdraw their life expectancy and a kind of mental energy called "Dreamland Capacity" to complete certain tasks beyond the limits of human physical capacity, such as exerting great force on objects, releasing light and heat, and repairing their own body. At the same time, messengers can also release a special substance called "Plastid" from the spiritual world, wielding the Plastid with distinct characteristics and shape to achieve excessive miracles that are somehow contrary to humans' normal perception of the world. Such powerful talent makes the messengers a more advanced form of life, equivalent to gods born among mortals. Their only similarities to ordinary humans are the level of intelligence, the most basic physical needs, and a relatively short lifespan. The messengers became the ruling class at the beginning of the civilization of various human races. In the long history of messenger’s domination, countless dynasties and regimes cycled between destruction and revival. The constants are the lofty status of messengers as the dominators of social resources, and the fact that all common humans have always been the bottom laborers. The messengers whose ancestry determines their abilities have established many countries under the monarchy, and formed the complete control of the territories by their own families. The antagonism between messenger families with regards to benefits and divergent beliefs eventually evolved into a tragic war that would involve all messenger groups.
	  
	  In the course of the war, a rising power emerged in human society that gradually developed mechanized production, and unexpectedly became the final winner. A few messengers who had separated from their original families and adopted more advanced moralities established a military organization called "Maple", which accepted a large number of ordinary humans who were regarded as slaves by traditional messengers and became unilateral victims in wars. Maple grasped the chance that the messengers suffered heavy losses in the civil war, relying on a more complete military command system, super-powered messengers and ordinary human forces equipped with modern firearms, to overthrow the brutal rule of each messenger family. Since then, the concepts of "country" and "war" have been eliminated. Maple Leaf established a highly concentrated central government, ruled all known areas suitable for human survival, established a social system that allocates resources equally to all humans and undertakes production tasks, and at the same time is committed to eliminating the remaining members of the old messenger families. The "dark age” dictated by the Old Messenger ends here.
	 
	  However, all this is just a set of glamorous rhetoric of Maple as a totalitarian ruler in a context that is beneficial to itself. Whether it is the status quo, history, or the position of the old messenger family, they are quite different from the values spread by Maple. 
	 
	  Maple divides all humans into three classes: management class, productive class, and class enemy.
	  
	  The management class is responsible for the operation of government departments at all levels and is composed of members of Maple itself and elites regularly selected from ordinary humans. In fact, normal people can't reach the core of power at all, and the highest positions they can assume can never involve the leadership of any official organization. It is a special group of people called "Maple Leaves" who truly grasp the power of the government, which accounts for 5 percent of the total human beings. All of them are the direct descendants of the messengers who first established Maple. They have inherited the power to govern all mankind and maintain the political authority with absolute violence. In any era, only a small number of members of any messenger group can activate integrated messenger abilities, and even fewer are eligible to possess plastids. Most of the maple leaves are not fundamentally different from ordinary humans, but as the top layer of the social pyramid, their living standards are significantly higher than ordinary humans. They have comfortable housing, fast transportation, better food rations, and more diverse entertainment methods. Maple Leaves are isolated from ordinary human society in many ways, among which the independent education and employment system are the most obvious. All young maple leaves must be enrolled in particular governmental schools after reaching the school-age and be assigned to different vocational training courses according to their different talents. The children will start from scratch, filtering out those without perfect messenger abilities, training into sheriffs who use violence to maintain Maple's rule. The majority, who have not been selected, will be brought up as various high-level talents, such as engineers, doctors, and politicians. Maple leaves generally have a relatively high level of education. Even if they do not work for the government, they can readily get a well-paid job in the society by virtue of their background. Maple has absolute control over maple leaves. Any rebellious behavior or spread of ideas that are contrary to Maple's values will lead to severe punishment. However, Maple Leaves themselves are divided into several factions due to different interests: some have sympathy and acceptance for ordinary humans, some are completely disdainful to be compared with "lower creatures", some tries to seek greater power, and some are obsessed with eradicating the old family messenger at any cost. These forces continued to confront each other secretly, and even reached the edge of a full-scale civil war.
	  
	  The productive class accounts for 90% of the total population and is a primary component of the entire society. To a certain extent, the productive class is equivalent to all ordinary human beings who intrinsically do not have the ability of messenger. As the main management positions and mental work types in society are fully occupied by the management class, the productive class is mainly responsible for manual labor. Because the economic system of the entire society is under excessive government control, the development of industry and commerce is continuously tardy, and the overall production efficiency of the society is low. Coupled with the monopoly of various valuable social resources by the management class, the productive class as a whole lives in poverty. The large rural area surrounds the city. The society demands great quantity of farmers who holds a large proportion of the population to engage in agricultural production, still being unable to solve the frequent shortage in regard to food supply. Even in cities, such as City 102 where the main event occurred in the game, buildings are evidently worn, the ruins left by the war more than ten years ago can still be seen everywhere. The factories established after the war continuously emit black smoke, sewage and dust. The entire city is always shrouded in a layer of gray color and the pungent smell of chemicals. People dress unfitly in unitary colors, travel by bicycle and live in small, stuffy residential buildings. The cultural level of the productive class is artificially restricted. After completing each level of education, children must pass an upgrade test to receive a higher level of education, and the degree of difficulty of the test will increase exponentially as the level increases. The education review department will even deliberately limit the proportion of students at each level to continue to upgrade. On average, only one in ten students who complete the sixth level of education can advance to the seventh level. Most of the children of urban residents will enroll in a two-year vocational and technical school after completing the sixth level of education. After graduation, they will be assigned to designated jobs (Basically, children from rural areas will only complete the most basic text and math education). The government limits and monitors the thought of the productive class in all perspectives. The people were immersed in the radical political slogans spread by the government's propaganda machine, and they were convinced of the legitimacy of the Maple Regime and the harm caused by the Old Family Messengers in the past. Including books, literary creations, and news media, all medias that have the function of disseminating ideas are subject to strict censorship. Voices in society that question the management class will not be tolerated. Everyone lives in chaos, being totally unaware of the past, having no imagination for the future. All they can do is to repeat their hard work day after day, expecting that their living conditions can be ameliorated owing to their own diligence, praising the great deeds of Maple as the savior who lead mankind liberation, incapable to recognize that the enjoyment of the entire management class originates from ruthless exploitation.
	  
	  The existence of class enemies is the manifestation of the confrontation between two different ideologies in reality, and it is also a means for Maple to shift the contradictions of production relations. Class enemy as an extremely formal title, in most cases it can be referred to as "traitor". Its main body is the old messenger family members who lost their ruling power in the war, but also includes all human-beings who provide any form of help to Old Family Messengers or having attempts to subvert Maple (the defectors among Maple Leaves will not be called traitors, since in Maple’s propaganda, Maple Leaves as the management class are perfect people with extremely high moral values, being absolutely impossible to betray). Normal humans who engage in rebellious acts are called traitors because they have lost their loyalty to the government. Calling the defeated family messengers a traitor is more like condemning their oppression of ordinary humans in the past as a behavior that betrayed mankind's virtue, and at the same time downplayed the fact that Maple whose founders were all originally from messenger families forsaken their fellow citizens indeed. The messengers of the old family who are now defined as "traitors", as former rulers, still have a huge ethnic group. Most of them are people who survived from the massacre of the old messenger families after the war. They do not have citizenship certification and cannot engage in most of the legal jobs in this society. Once the true identity is revealed, they will be chased by the sheriff immediately. In law, class enemies do not have human rights and are not protected by any legal provisions. All citizens are obliged to report to the government security department after confirming the existence of the class enemy, and unconditionally assist Maple's sheriff to eliminate the class enemy.
	  
	  <label style="font-size:24px;font-weight:900">Characters</label>
	  There are three protagonists in the game: Grayson Chennell, Nancy Dorland and Ember Logan.
	  
	  <b>Grayson Chennell</b> is a sheriff attached to the government. He was born in an ordinary messenger family of the management class, possessing orthodox maple leaf bloodline. Grayson spent his time before grown-up away from the frontline of "Continued War" (a war against the last old messenger group, the House of Lindworm). Unlike his parents who are engaged in clerical work, talented Grayson has received professional training for progressing messenger abilities since he was a child, inheriting the plastid that Maple has transformed due to his specialties. After his official service, he became one of Maple's sheriffs, patrolling between cities, apparently searching for rebellious messengers left by the old messenger families. His actual errand is to secretly eradicate Maple Leaves that is deemed by the organization to be collaborating with the enemy, and collect information for Maple conservatives to use against radicals in the course of government operations. Although he did not sympathize with the persecuted old messenger family, Grayson could not fully accept the ideology of Maple due to his long-term exposure to the unspeakable side of the system. However, the relatively superior living conditions and collective sense of belonging that Maple Leaves provided him made his essential loyalty to Maple unshakable. Since then, Grayson gave up on pursuing the so-called honor or realizing a certain lofty ideal, established his life goal as "self-satisfaction", hoping to feel as much happiness as possible in his short lifetime. His definition of happiness is not harsh, only the most basic material enjoyment in life and the company of a few close fellows. For him, depriving others of their lives or saving lives is only necessary work, which neither makes him cheerful nor sad, just a little troublesome. Grayson expects that his life will always be the normal state he acquaints. Nonetheless, the unexpected disappearance of <b>Nina Chalice</b>, his confidant, in City 102, wavers his sluggish and graceful fantasy. Nina's whereabouts becomes an insurmountable obsession for Grayson, and as a sheriff, he has to plan a secret operation in City 102 with the intention of exploring the truth behind Nina's disappearance.
	 
	  The second protagonist of the game, <b>Nancy Dorland</b>, is a worker in an electronic component factory and the mother of three children. Now raising her children alone, Nancy has an unknown cruel past. Nancy is the offspring of old messenger family born in the turbulent period after the end of the Continued War. After being abandoned, she was accidentally mistaken by an ordinary human couple for their previously missing newborn daughter. She was ignorant of her own lineage since she was a child, received the brainwashing education from Maple to all citizens, and was instilled totalitarian thought that "Old Family Messengers are all enemies that must be eliminated" "Maple represents absolute justice and truth”. However, in a premeditated large-scale public safety incident with political purposes, Nancy liberated the courier messenger instinct that had been suppressed and saved the lives of many innocent people. Her worldview and values have changed since then. Driven by her kind nature, Nancy began to explore the nature of the contradiction between the messenger and human beings and seek a reasonable solution, but was once again used by people with ulterior motives. She was forced to fight for the underground organization against Maple, the "United Family Revolutionary Army", dedicated her youth and strength to the so-called great cause of liberating the oppressed people, indirectly led to another city being taken and slaughtered by extremists among old family messengers (Second Rebellion). At the same time, her own family members either became persecutors or victims during the collective political persecution of betrayers, eventually all stepped to absurd death. For a time, Nancy fell into complete despair, feeling endlessly confused about the meaning of life, until the revolutionary army forced her to pass on her messenger ability through reproduction. The birth of the child gave Nancy unprecedented courage and awakened her free will. She managed to escape from the revolutionary army that regarded her as a war machine as well as a fertility tool, and returned to City 102 that were devastated after the political movement ended. Here, Nancy started a quiet life incognito, forming a strong and warm family with her children. Her life is gradually on the right track in the usual sense, but everything she has experienced in the past has deeply implanted a strong love and hatred in her soul. Witnessing how terrible human nature’s greed for power and material can cause, and also personally experiencing how it feels to destroy others and themselves by such greed, Nancy firmly believes that it is an unforgivable sin to treat an innocent person as the sacrifice for alleged grand purpose. This notion makes her unable to forgive those within management class or the betrayers who have repeatedly caused scourges for human beings, involving herself who committed the same sin. She has been waiting for the opportunity, waiting for the day when redemption and judgment are carried out with her filthy hands, waiting for the day when truth regains its dignity. And this time, she hopes that she can be the only martyr.
	  
	  The third protagonist,<b>Ember Logan</b>,is a young man who has received higher education. He comes from a very small number of relatively high-income families in the productive class, and has had favorable living conditions since childhood. Ember's father is a savvy businessman and has repeatedly helped his household through the unsettled situation in City 102. In the frenetic political environment for more than ten years, his business had never suffered a devastating impact. Ember grew up under the care of his family and cultivated a sense of empathy and justice far beyond his peers, while his cognition of the world is comparatively shallow. Until he met a young female named <b>Yukina</b>,his life had an unprecedented turnaround. Ember fortuitously discovered a terrible secret hidden by Yukina:<b>Lindworm Family</b> that was defeated in the Continued War still exists in City 102 and retains massed members. Yukina is one of them. After internal struggles, Ember's humanity has overcome the hatred education he has received all the time, choosing to remain silent and not reveal Yukina's true identity to Maple. Soon after that, Yukina took the initiative to communicate with him and confessed the truth. For unknown reasons, Ember was discovered by Yukina that he had a complete plastid without the blood of any known messenger family. Lindworm family later confirmed that Ember was not Maple Leaf, totally unaware of his own abilities, and suspected that he was transformed into a messenger for some abnormal reasons. The moderates in the Lindworm family tried to protect Ember from being regarded by the sheriff as a member of the old messenger family, but were not sure whether Ember would betray them. So, they planned a test of Ember, by exposing the uncertain existence of the family to him, to discern Ember's attitude towards the old messenger family. Once Ember tries to report Yukina, Lindworm will immediately eliminate him. This is the tendency of the vast majority of the members of the Lindworm family, or that they intend to kill Ember as an uncertainty in the most direct way from the beginning (Due to hostility between the old messenger families, it is difficult for them to trust outsiders). Ember felt strong dissatisfaction after learning the truth, and was angry that his right to life was controlled by a group of people who had nothing to do with him. Yukina's enlightenment on him changed Ember's mind. What he experienced in this farce is exactly the fate faced by all the messengers of the old family today: they don’t know why they are not allowed to live in this world, don't know when the right to live will be deprived for no reason. Under the guidance (and bewitching) of Yukina, Ember started to make friendly contact with the Lindworm family as a messenger but holding the position of ordinary human. He realized that the old family messengers were truly not the unforgivable demons that Maple described. This big family was very cautiously struggling to survive on the margins of society, seldom used force unless their own survival has been threatened, could not even being distinguished from ordinary humans in daily life. Driven by his own moral values, Ember began to secretly help the poor individuals in the Lindworm family, and in the process established sincere friendships with many members of the Lindworm family. Over the years, Ember gradually establishes his ideals. He hopes that with his efforts, the prejudice and hatred in society can be changed, and finally a reconciliation between the messenger and mankind can be reached, and a once and for all peace can be reached. He also realizes that such a pursuit would undoubtedly put himself on the opposite side of Maple or even the whole society. It demands a practical plan and consume lifelong effort to achieve it. But not until Ember to practice his ideals, a contingency happened first. Yukina rebel Lindworm and defected to Maple. The information of any member of the family is likely to be completely exposed to Maple. Lindworm is about to face a bloody hunt. Ember, who has always secretly admired Yukina, cannot understand why that gorgeous woman who taught him tolerance and love would choose to betray their common faith, yet there is no time to hesitate. He might stop this cycle of tragedy, or become a part of it. Regardless of the ending, all he can do is to unfold his plastid.
