let message1 = "\nMost days, I wish I hadn't been given the ability to do anything for myself. It's nice that I can feed myself and use the toilet on my own, for what I hope are obvious reasons. The act of operating an elevator properly is the high point of my day — the moment where I can choose the floor I want is like having a weight lifted off of my chest. And so on and so forth.\n\nThe thing about agency is that even the smallest drop opens the door for guilt. There are an assortment of very good reasons why I'm not responsible for what I do, but whenever I do anything more than put one foot in front of the other, I can't shake away the thought: <em>You could have stopped yourself.</em> Guilt is the one emotion I've always felt strongly, and it's doing me no favors now.\n\nEvery so often, I'll try to count the bodies — memorializing them, if only in aggregate — but my body is usually steering me away before I can get a look at everyone. It's a shame, because I'm very good at memorization (always have been, actually) and could keep an accurate tally if I was allowed. Now, <em>that</em> has done me favors — my memory is what allows me to \"write\" this. Writing still brings satisfaction even when I'm the whole audience.\n\nBut I digress. My point is, I am a writer, and with some effort I can still do it in a limited fashion. I construct narratives. Here are two narratives.\n\nThe first entails me being placed into a body that goes around and makes people kill each other in a blind panic. I am a decent person, and I find this very tragic, and I wish that it wasn't happening, or at the very least that I was not forced to participate. Even the faintest whiff of agency is enough to make me doubt and blame myself. It happens anyways.\n\nThe second entails me being placed into a body that goes around and makes people kill each other in a blind panic. I am an evil man who takes great joy in this, only wishing that I could take control of my body and do it more often. Every moment where I can move for myself gives me hope that this might happen. Things proceed as normal.\n\nYou'll notice that empathy and decency only cause me anguish; I doubt they alleviate the pain of being crushed under a pile of screaming humanity. My teachers always said that a logical, detached perspective was one of my strengths.\n\nThere's a moment, when the crowd's fervor reaches its fever pitch, where I have a chance to express myself. Not speech, unfortunately. But whatever I'm feeling comes out, if I let it.\n\nI'm tired of crying. Maybe I should <a href=\"http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1268\">laugh.\n\n"

let message2 = "\nThe sound of shrieking klaxons could be heard over the muffled shouts and dull thumps coming through the door. The interior of the chamber was still, the long rows of shelves filled with metal boxes and lockers remaining undisturbed by the chaos outside. The sound of thumps was getting louder however, as whatever was causing it grew nearer.\n\nThen one of the walls caved inwards.\n\nThrough the dust and debris burst a large reptile, its head swinging left and right looking for any danger or people to eat. Finding nothing, it climbed over the pile of what was formerly a wall to check the room for any routes to the surface.\n\nThe sound of gunfire from the other side of hole in the wall caused its head to snap upwards. It let out a deafening bellow as several bullets bit into its side. After the first few shots, its skin gained a metallic hue and the bullets began to ricochet off into the walls.\n\n\"DISGUSTING FLESHBAGS, I SHALL FEAST UPON THE INNARDS OF YOUR REVOLTING SPAWN BEFORE SUCKING THE MARROW FROM YOUR BONES!\"\n\nThe reptile ran towards the opposite wall, knocking over shelves in its wake and sending their contents scattering. The wall ahead of it crumbled as it barreled through.\n\nA team of heavily armed men and women walked through the wall the reptile had entered from, advancing cautiously towards the other side of the room.\n\n\"682 has entered Hallway B6-17, headed towards Research Labs, we are in pursuit. Prepare for ambush at intersection B6-17-103.\"\n\nThe heavy boots of the squad crunched over broken masonry, glass and metal as they passed through to the other side of the room and the hole the beast had left through. After scouting the other side to ensure it wasn't lying in wait, the rest of the team left the room to pursue its quarry.\n\nThe sound of roaring and gunshots became fainter again as the battle moved away. The dust in the chamber began to settle on the wreckage left in the wake of the carnage.\n\nThe room was still.\n\nA quiet sound began, at first so faint it might not have even been there. If anyone had been there to hear it, they might have thought they heard a soft beeping coming from one of the safes that had been knocked to the floor. It was lying on its side, and one half of the door had been twisted from its hinges.\n\n\"SELF-PRESERVATION MODE ACTIVATED. DO NOT DAMAGE ROBO-DUDE. DAMAGING ROBO-DUDE VOIDS THE DR.

WONDERTAINMENT IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION TO PERSONS OR PROPERTY RESULTING FROM IMPROPER HANDLING OF ROBO-DUDE. GREETINGS, ROBO-PAL.\"\n\nThe remaining hinge on the safe began to sizzle until, sufficiently weakened by the acid that had been applied, the weight of the mangled door caused it to break free.\n\nA toy robot shuffled out of the safe and stood amid the wreckage, looking for what had caused it to be activated. Its boxy plastic shape had trouble moving over the plaster and metal shards, but it eventually managed to find a section of flat ground without too many obstructions.\n\n\"ROBO-PAL?\"\n\nAnother shape began to stir amid the dust. The toy robot turned towards the sound.\n\n\"GREETINGS ROBO-PAL. HOW DO YOU WANT TO HAVE ROBO-FUN WITH ROBO-DUDE TODAY?\"\n\n\"Who dares to call me robo-pal. I am the Crushmaster, doom to all I survey. Gaze upon my might and weep. Identify yourself, that I might know whose destruction I shall sow.\"\n\nThe shape advanced through the cloud of dust until it resolved itself. It too, appeared to be a robot, but assembled haphazardly from a collection of items that didn't seem like they should even form a functioning machine. Its head was a broken upside-down voltmeter, its arms were wrenches sticking out of flashlight bodies, and its legs seemed to be made from a combination of springs, metal piping, and sporks.\n\n\"I AM ROBO-DUDE, ROBO-PAL. I AM EQUIPPED WITH OVER THREE HUNDRED FUN ACCESSORIES TO MAXIMIZE PLAYTIME ENJOYMENT.\"\n\nThe Crushmaster wobbled awkwardly over to the plastic toy, nearly tumbling over a few times, before stopping maybe a meter away. It stood a good four or five times taller than the diminutive Robo-Dude, and if anyone else had been watching, they might have thought that it tried to stand a little higher on its sporks than it had a moment ago.\n\n\"I am Direfist the Bloodeater and I shall maximize my enjoyment by squashing you beneath my almighty boot. Prepare to face my wrath.\"\n\nRobo-Dude looked down at Direfist's sporks. It looked back up.\n\n\"ROBO-DUDE SHALL ENGAGE IN ROBO-DANCE TO MAXIMIZE YOUR ROBO-FUN.\"\n\nRobo-Dude engaged its Robo-Dance.\n\n\"Very well, puny weakling, I, Sparklord the Barbarian, shall defeat you at your Robo-Dancing to bring humiliations galore upon you and your ilk before I rend your soul into itty-bitty pieces.\"\n\nSparklord began to gyrate precariously about its centre of mass, hopelessly out of tune with the tinny music emerging from a speaker somewhere on Robo-Dude's body.\n\n\"ROBO-DUDE HAS RECOGNIZED A ROBO-DANCE CHALLENGE. CHALLENGE ACCEPTED. ACTIVATING ROBO-DANCE-OFF MODE.\"\n\n\"Activate all that you wish, but your fate is sealed. The Kill-o-tron can not be defeated. I shall render you unto dust with my mad dancing skills.\"\n\nThe two mechanical men began to dance in earnest. Robo-Dude accessed its optimum dance programming, performing to its maximum abilities. Kill-o-tron stumbled around the open space, falling over no less than seven times, and somehow managed to lose one of its wrenches.\n\nAfter about thirty minutes, the music stopped, and the two robots ceased dancing. Kill-o-tron managed to untangle the tines of its spork from a metal wire it had caught in.\n\n\"ROBO-DANCE IS COMPLETE, ROBO-PAL.\"\n\n\"Ha. Pathetic one, you have been schooled in the art of the dance by none other than Mechanobasher, Scourge of a Thousand Worlds. Kneel before me before I end your worthless existence.\"\n\nMechanobasher, Scourge of a Thousand Worlds, raised its arms up in victory, its remaining wrench waving to an imaginary crowd.\n\n\"ROBO-DUDE HAS USED ITS ROBO-DANCE-JUDGE PROGRAMMING TO DETERMINE A WINNER. THE WINNER IS ROBO-DUDE. CONGRATULATIONS ROBO-DUDE.\"\n\n\"What insolence. Prepare to feel the sting of Doctor Von Vroom, Purveyor of Doom.\"\n\nVon Vroom began to advance on Robo-Dude, its sole wrench twirling menacingly in its socket.\n\n\"ROBO-DUDE HAS DETECTED A SORE LOSER. ROBO-DUDE DEPLOYING HYDROGEN CANNON TO EDUCATE ROBO-PAL ON BEING A GOOD SPORT.\"\n\nThe compartment on Robo-Dude's chest opened, and a jet of water shot out at Von Vroom. Von Vroom's sporks lost traction on the wet floor, and it fell over onto its back.\n\n\"How dare you. Right me immediately so that you may taste your destruction at the hands of the Supreme Stabbinator.\"\n\nRobo-Dude watched as the Supreme Stabbinator flailed around on its back as managing to make small circles on the floor, but it was unable to lift itself off of the wet concrete.\n\n\"I shall obliterate you atom by atom until not a trace that your worthless form even existed upon this wretched planet if I am not righted immediately, so says I, Deathkill the Destructionator, King of Kings and Lord of Lords.\"\n\n\"DO NOT INTIMIDATE ROBO-DUDE.\"\n\n"
let message3 = "\n<em>Drip</em>\n\nHe was lurking in the shadows of an old oak grove, gazing at the dark, brooding form of the facility on the hill above. She was there. Drop after drop fell on Feldspar's head, as he remembered the day of the betrayal. The day she came for them. The day they died.\n\n<em>Drop</em>\n\nIt wasn't supposed to be like this. Feldspar remembered the first time he saw her, all those years ago. Just a frightened young woman, seeking protection from some very dangerous people. She never said how she located them, or what she did to earn the ire of the Double Blade Triad, but she knew his family had a solid reputation of dealing with folks like them, so she turned to them for help. His father, hard man though he was, never even thought about refusing, and they took her in.\n\n<em>Drip</em>\n\nShe was the most beautiful thing he ever saw: slender, gracious, fragile, every feature of her glowing with an almost radiant whiteness. She was everything he and his family weren't, but she had nowhere else to go. Hidden beneath the wet leaves, he recalled the first few days they spent together, during that long, lost summer. She seemed so shy at first, seemingly folding into herself every time anyone tried to talk to her. He couldn't blame her, considering what she'd been through; though she tried very hard to hide them, Feldspar could see the cuts left on her arms where the Triad hurt her. He swore he would never let their blades touch her again.\n\n<em>Drop</em>\n\nThey grow close during her stay with his family. She quickly opened up to them, and they in turned soften up to her. She became fast friends with his little sister, and they'd spend entire evenings sitting on the balcony, chatting about nothing much and giggling like little girls. His mother was very protective of her, never letting her help in the kitchen in fear she'd hurt herself. Even his father soon learned to respect her. And Feldspar, well, he was smitten from the very first moment he saw her, and getting to know her better only made it easier to love her. They used to go on long trips together, hiking down the winding dirt roads that surrounded his family's grounds. What a pair they must have seen to an outside observer- she fleet-footed and light, he heavy and ponderous. She seemed better now, after a few months in the company of good people, but he saw it was just an act. She was still hurting, still scared to the bottom of her soul from the day the Triad would come for her.\n\n<em>Drip</em>\n\nThat day came, and much sooner than any of them expected. They were just coming back from one of their hikes, when, rounding the corner, he saw a flash of garish orange and dull steel, and they were upon him. There must have been at least a dozen of them, and their long blades flashed upon his body a hundred times within moments of their initial attacks. Their attack was fast, brutal and overwhelming, but they forgot one very important thing.\n\nBlades didn't do much against the likes of him.\n\nHe broke them, every single one. Each pain they inflicted upon her he returned tenfold, and when he was done, so was the Double Blade Triad. He let a few of them get away, their long blades shattered, to send a message to the rest. They told him he didn't understand, that she wasn't what she appeared to be. He didn't listen.\n\n<em>Drop</em>\n\nOnce the Triad was gone, they could finally be together. Those were the happiest days in Feldspar's life. He would return from a day in the field to find her waiting for him, her face covered in ink from one art project or another. He would laugh and wipe it away, and look into those big black eyes of hers, thinking how lucky he was. His family couldn't have been happier for them. Things were looking good. Things were looking great. Until that day.\n\n<em>Drip</em>\n\nFeldspar shivered as he recalled that final walk home. It was a day much like this one, grey and gloomy, and he was anxious to be home. He was covered in mud, tired, wet, and in desperate need of a good wash, and so he returned an hour early. He noticed something wasn't right the moment he entered the house. The usual ambiance noises were replaced with a deathly quiet, and there was no sign of the residents. He couldn't imagine his family going out on a miserable day like this, so he went around the house, calling their names, getting increasingly worried with each empty room. The house was empty. Lost for thought, he went on to check the only place left- the garden shed.\n\n<em>Drop</em>\n\nShe was there, standing over the corpses of his family, looking down on her grisly work. His sister, who was her best friend, looked like she was strangled in her sleep. His mother, who cared for her like one of her own, must have been ambushed and strangled from behind, from the expression now forever frozen on her face. His father, who let down his guard to make her feel at home, seemed to have put out a fight- her skin, still white as snow, was carrying the marks of his last desperate struggle. It wasn't enough. Finally noticing him, she gave him a smile like a razor blade. \"How was your day, honey?\"\n\n\"Why?\" Was all he could say.\n\n\"Why?\" she said, slowly advancing on him, \"Because you never saw it coming, because it was easy, because you let me. Because I could.\"\n\n\"We saved you! We looked after you! How could you do this to them!? They loved you! I loved you!\"\n\nFor a moment, something like the a shadow of regret flashed on her face. It was gone just as fast. \"Well. Bad call, I guess. Goodbye.\"\n\nShe moved faster than he could have thought possible, and he gasped in horror as her skin began to extend, covering him, suffocating him, drowning him in pure whiteness. He struggled, but his heavy form was ill suited for such a fight. The last thing heard before he collapsed was \"Oh, and thank you for dealing with the Double Blades, baby. They were the only ones who could stop me. Now, I can finally move on to the big leagues.\"\n\n<em>Drip</em>\n\nFeldspar had no idea why she let him live. Perhaps she still loved him, somewhere deep inside. Perhaps she just wanted to see him suffer. Feldspar didn't care. He didn't care that he didn't know where she was, or that she was much smarter and faster and stronger than him. He would find her, and he would kill her, no matter where she went.\n\n<em>Drop</em>\n\nAnd now he was here. Tracking her down to this facility wasn't easy, but luckily for him, he had several associates in critical positions inside. He wasn't sure what she wanted to do there, or how she made it in, considering how clever the men in charge of the facility were supposed to be. Most likely she used their intelligence against them, made them think she was theirs to control, that they were the one who created her. It seemed like her style, and she had done it before. He wondered what she called herself now.\n\nHe heard that they called her SCP-085. Cassy. That papery bitch was so close he could almost touch her, and she had nowhere to run now. There was only one issue left to resolve.\n\n<em>Drip</em>\n\nHow the hell was he going to roll up that hill?\n\n"
let message4="\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that we can\u2019t close 826 until\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cUntil somebody finishes the main narrative, yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we still don\u2019t know where the skip is\u2026 hiding, in the setting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is also correct.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the hell happened? It never screwed up like this before.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as we can tell, the interaction between the item, along with the book and matching electronic media caused the anomaly. We never tested 826 with multiple formats of matching subject matter.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 God dammit. What now?\u201d\n\n\u201cI suggest we send an expeditionary force to retrieve the item. However, because of the nature of the setting, only one Agent may be sent at a time. We sent a three-man team in and they exploded.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, it has been found that we can retrieve inorganic items from the setting and keep them indefinitely within our world. While we do believe that they will degrade and vanish once the setting is closed, I believe that this gives us a\u2026 how does one say, cheat code, in winning back SCP-826.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 what kinds of \u2018inorganic items\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease come with me. We have some preparations to make.\u201d<hr />Dr Django Bridge had offered to house the Bookends at his Site for a while. While Site-66 is labelled as a Bio-Site, it usually houses miscellaneous animate SCP objects that may or may not be organic. Of course, he did this with the expectation that the other Doctors would keep their stuff out of his stuff. And of course, everything always cocks up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an Agent. Why do I have to-\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have proven in the past to be an expert when it comes to the current circumstances of the item.\u201d said the ginger-headed research assistant.\n\nBridge was being pulled down the hall by several Agents and Research Assistant Steve, towards the unused area of the Site.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t even make sense. What did you do to my site?!\u201d Bridge was irate.\n\n\u201cListen, I\u2019m just reading from a script, my doc wants you to do it.\u201d They turned a corner and reached a door to a testing chamber.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what you people are doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cErr sorry. Just take the instructions and backpack.\u201d And with that, a large backpack was hefted into Bridge\u2019s arms by an Agent, and the paper into his hands.\n\n\u201c\u2026 Fine. Whatever. Okay. I\u2019ll do your fucking mission.\u201d\n\nAs everyone else piled out, Bridge looked at the portal. A door of white light, opening to the unknown fuckup beyond. He took a deep breath, then a long sigh. Sure, he\u2019s messed up here and there. The cockup with the lizard and ticket, yes, that was a bad move. Taking photographs of Birth Worm wearing funny hats? Yes, okay, that\u2019s dumb. But what the HELL did he do to deserve this?\n\nOh well. After several minutes of dread and reflection, he slung on the pack and stepped in.<hr />\u201cSo why is the guy who pulled the bullshit with the ticket going in to retrieve this skip?\u201d Agent Dodridge leaned against a wall, watching monitors watching Bridge.\n\n\u201cEh, it can\u2019t hurt. At best, everyone and everything comes back unharmed. At worst, he dies.\u201d Agent Lament shrugged. He sat at the desk and got comfortable.\n\n\u201cYeah, but wouldn\u2019t one of us do better? This guy\u2019s a fucking\u2026 archivist? According to his file.\u201d\n\n\u201cThrow him a bone. He\u2019ll appreciate it if he survives.\u201d<hr />Bridge opened his eyes and looked around. A bedroom; a bed in one corner, computer\u2026 A TV and Super Nintendo sitting in the middle of the floor, that\u2019s a bit strange. Shrug. Stairs in the corner of the bedroom. What\u2026? Whatever.\n\nHe descended the stairs, noticing a woman at a table. Okay. Seems non-hostile.\n\n\u201c\u2026 hello?\u201d He tapped the woman on the shoulder. She turned and smiled.\n\n\u201cRight. All boys leave home someday. It said so on TV. Prof. Oak, next door, is looking for you.\u201d\n\nHe froze for a moment, staring at the woman, before running out the front door and looking around. A larger building to the left, empty fields to the right, a small fence before him, water beyond. He dropped the backpack and finally read the mission brief Steve gave him.\n<blockquote>Dr. Bridge. Enclosed is a set of mission-appropriate equipment, a photograph of SCP-826, and a packed lunch. Please retrieve SCP-826 as soon as humanly possible, and do not allow the complete destruction of any of the provided items. If our theories are correct, if you reach a \u201cgame over\u201d, you will die.\n- Agent Lament\n\n</blockquote>Inside the bag were six red and white spheres, numbered 1 through 6.\n\n\u201c\u2026 My mission is a Pok\u00e9mon Red Nuzlocke with a hacked team. Fuck yes.\u201d He turned and started off north, sticking a foot into knee-height grass.\n\n\u201cHey wait! Don\u2019t go out!\u201d He stopped. He turned to see an old man with a lab coat making his way towards him. \u201cIt\u2019s unsafe!\u201d \u201cGo away-\u201d \u201cWild Pok\u00e9mon live in the tall grass! You need your own Pok\u00e9mon for your protection.\u201d \u201cI really don-\u201d \u201cI know!\u201d \u201cStop-\u201d \u201cHere, come with me!\u201d \u201cNo dammit-\u201d\n\nOak dragged Bridge to his lab, next to a scowling kid. \u201cGramps! I\u2019m fed up with waiting!\u201d \u201cGary? Hm, let me think\u2026 Oh, that\u2019s right, I told you to come! Just wait! Here, Django\u2026\u201d\n\nBridge ignored the script, tapping his foot impatiently. As soon as Oak was done talking, he turned to leave.\n\n\u201cWait Django! Lets check out our Pok\u00e9mon! Come on, I\u2019ll take you on!\u201d\n\nWith a flash of light, a Charmander appeared before Bridge. He picked Ball #1 from his belt and -\n\nA flash of light; a flash of red; a huge, hulking thing appeared. A spine-sail down its back; its mouth filled with enormous, glowing, red teeth; sightless, eyeless face; unmoving mouth, laughing with many voices.\n\n\u201c\u2026 Oh my god.\u201d<hr /> \u201c\u2026 What the fuck.\u201d Dodridge breathed flatly.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the one we shot the lungs out of. In the game world it won\u2019t kill Bridge. I think. \u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 Really? REALLY?\u201d<hr /> The thing laughed at Charmander, screaming in four distinct voices. Charmander shivered, then leapt and scratched it across the face.<table class=\"wiki-content-table\"><tr><td>SCP-939\u2019s INTIMIDATE cut enemy CHARMANDER\u2019s ATTACK!</td></tr><tr><td>CHARMANDER\u2019s ATTACK fell!</td></tr><tr><td>CHARMANDER used SCRATCH!</td></tr></table>Telepathic game prompts. Time to make shit up.\n\n\u201cCrunch!\u201d<hr /> \u201cWell that was violent.\u201d remarked Lament.\n\n\u201cWhat do you fucking expect? What else has he got?!\u201d<hr /> Three hours later, Bridge was strolling through Cerulean City, into the Pok\u00e9mon Center. Poking his head in every building, looking in every bookshelf, in every PC, there was no 826. He DID have the Boulder Badge though. Sherman took care of Brock.\n\nEntering the Gym, he tossed a ball into the pool. Three minutes later, he stepped out, Bob hopping behind. To the Nugget Bridge!<hr />\u201cHe\u2019s enjoying this too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cEh, let him have his fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo look at him. These are war crimes. They melted.\u201d<hr/> Three more hours, and Bridge exited Celadon Gym, with Lazerbeak gliding close behind.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kickass, Laze. How do you know Steel Wing? That\u2019s not around till Gen 2.\u201d\n\n\u201cSCRAW!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is a horrible noise.\u201d<hr/>\u201cWhy do they listen to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, that thing doesn\u2019t even move until night. How\u2019d you even acquire any of these? Zero Seventy Five is a high, high risk Keter. The fuck\u2019s with these Doctors?\u201d\n\n\u201cI honestly have no idea. Wasn\u2019t me who put the forms in. Steve rolled a bunch of dice and used the numbers to requisition for testing.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 god damn it Steve.\u201d<hr/>Bridge exited Saffron Gym riding on Pazuzu\u2019s shoulders. The dried up, shuddering corpse shivered and twitched, ignored by Bridge and the rest of the fucknormous spider beast.\n\n\u201cAwesome job Pazuzu. You fucking decapitated \u2018Zam with that last X-Scissor. I am in no way surprised that you\u2019re Dark-Bug type, hell, I\u2019m not even going to ask why your attacks are ahead of your time. Just keep kicking ass.\u201d\n\n\u201cHhh-\u201d coughed the corpse. \u201cSh-K!-ssss\u201d shrieked the spider.\n\nThey rode off to Route 19.<hr/>\u201c\u2026 Goddamn. It ate the fucking mime.\u201d Dodridge sank into a seat.\n\n\u201cMISTER, Mime, to be completely accurate.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up. Just shut up. I feel sick.\u201d<hr/>\u201c\u2026 I wonder\u2026\u201d Bridge leaned on Cinnabar Island\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon Center\u2019s counter, waiting for the healing machine to finish. Blaine\u2019s Gym is was babies.\n\n\u201c\u2026 fuckit.\u201d He grabbed his balls and headed outside, calling on Lazerbeak to fly him to Viridian.

He made his way to the shoreline, tossed Welker into the water, and climbed on its shoulders.\n\nThey swam for a few minutes up and down the shoreline. Then\u2026 something appeared. Without warning, the skies darkened; a tall pillar of glitch code flourished into being in before Bridge and Welker.<table class=\"wiki-content-table\"><tr><td>Wild MISSINGNO. appeared!</td></tr><tr><td>WELKER\u2019s INTIMIDATE cut enemy MISSINGNO.\u2019 ATTACK!</td></tr></table>\u201cRecontainment of Theta-Prime commencing.\u201d Bridge muttered with a grin as he hopped into the shallows.

Just settle down and let me look for 106.\u201d<hr/>Two hours later, Bridge exited the Viridian Gym, Johnny in tow. The city burned, small cracks forming in the sky, Glitchmon leaking through.

The room freezing, containing only a floating dock on a deep, deep pool. \u201cI am Lorelei of the Elite Four!\u201d\n\nBridge sighed, dropping a ball. It burst into light, the dock creaking under the Bob\u2019s insane weight.\n\n\u201cNo one can best me when it comes to icy Pok\u00e9mon!\u201d Lorelei laughed. \u201cFreezing moves are powerful!

Soon, Dewgong floated to the surface and returned to its ball. Another flash of light, and a plop to the side as Cloyster clamped and dove in; soon, it returned to Lorelei in a red light.\n\nThe docks started sinking. Lorelei\u2019s Jynx fired silver Icebeams into the water and waves of telekinetic force battered the pool; neither Ice nor Psychic attacks could strike the irrationally agile snail. Soon the docks gave way under Jynx and it fell into the water. Another burst of red, then white, then red light, and Lorelei\u2019s Lapras fell through the rest of the sinking docks.\n\nBridge stretched and began walking, then running to the next door. In a last-second Indiana Jones maneuver, Bridge slid under the closing door to Bruno and returned Bob to its ball.\n\n\u201cSorry to give you the cold shoulder, but I have places to be.\u201d<hr/>\u201cI\u2019m gonna kill him.\u201d Dodridge\u2019s eye twitched.\n\nLament burst out laughing.\n\n\u201cStraight up murder him in his sleep.\u201d Twitch twitch.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more annoyed at the choice of attacks.

A misshapen boxer in pink shorts punched a burning hole into the Stick Blob, only to be incinerated by a wave not unlike a supernova. A blemmyes with stretchy legs and a second stone snake followed their friend into scorched oblivion. The Burning Man simply incinerated everything in what can only be described as excessive proactive retaliation.\n\nA flash of metal, and the thud of muscle on stone, and the final fighters graced the field with their presence. The metal hawk Lazerbeak took flight; Bruno\u2019s prized Machamp flexed and posed in defiance.<table class=\"wiki-content-table\"><tr><td>LAZERBEAK flew up high!</td></tr><tr><td>Enemy MACHAMP used FOCUS ENERGY!

It leapt into shadows, silently flanking Gengar and hacking it apart with gusto; sparks of violet light burned from Pazuzu\u2019s claws. A Golbat replaced the ghost; ambushing Pazuzu with a smack of its wings, the spider turned into another slash, hewing the horrible flying mouth cleanly in two. After a moment, a huge cobra reared its head behind Pazuzu, only to be thwarted by the corpse with a backhand.<table class=\"wiki-content-table\"><tr><td>ELITE FOUR AGATHA sent out HAUNTER!</td></tr><tr><td>PAZUZU used SUCKER PUNCH!

The Haunter appeared, and tried to bite the corpses\u2019 head; it yelped in fright as the spider awoke and stabbed it into the wall, scrambling up into the dark. As the final Gengar appeared, Pazuzu dropped onto it, impaling the ghost with all eight legs.\n\"You win! I see what the old duff sees in you now. I've nothing else to say.

He looked around the penultimate room; huge statues of nondescript dragons adorned the walls, with brass torches hanging from the ceiling. As he took in the sight, an errant quote passed through his mind.<table class=\"wiki-content-table\"><tr><th><a href=\"http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-826\">\u2026During this transformation process, SCP-826, along with the contained book, will relocate to another part of the book\u2019ts setting, showing a preference for places where books are normally found (libraries, studies, etc)\u2026</a></th></tr></table>\u201cPreference. Preference implies that this isn\u2019t a hard and fast rule, just the prevailing behavioural trend that a creative object will show in a particular situation during testing.\u201d Bridge murmured to himself; in a moment he caught a glimpse of silver-grey against the bronze walls behind Lance. The Bookends.\n\u201cYou know that dragons are mythical Pok\u00e9mon! They\u2019re hard to catch and raise, but their powers are superior! They\u2019re virtually indestructible!

Welker vanished, replaced by Pazuzu the horrid, twitching, choking corpse-spider-monster and Sherman the giant pile of sticks. Immediately, the marionette leapt out of the way and clung to the ceiling, and the Sherman cried out, shooting razor-sharp foliage in every direction. The Dragonairs, badly cut, slithered in unison, moving quicker and quicker into a pair of silvery blurs\u2026 until Pazuzu impaled both into the floor and Sherman ran them over like a runaway cyclone of conifers. In one last ditch effort, the serpents slammed their tails in unison against the spider and stack, before being diced and smashed to soup.<table class=\"wiki-content-table\"><tr><td>ELITE FOUR LANCE sent out AERODACTYL!</td></tr><tr><td>Good work, PAZUZU and SHERMAN!

Instead, it busied itself with\u2026 sweating. The Dragonite fell to one knee, taking a breath, exhausted by its effort\u2026 until it was messily decapitated by the snail launching itself like a cannonball across the field, its whole weight and caustic slime liquefying the dragon\u2019s skull, Lance\u2019s skull, and burning a hole through the door beyond.<hr/>Agent Dodridge sat there, expressionless, staring at the screen for several seconds. With an annoyed grunt he suddenly stood up and flipped the table.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go bang my hot wife. Debrief this loser. Smell ya later.\u201d he called to Lament.\n\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t get angry. It\u2019s not his fault Charizard\u2019s not a real dragon.\u201d\n\nDodridge turned and walked out, fists clenched. He never swept Lance like that. He always spent fifteen or twenty Max Revives on his team. It\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s not fair.<hr/>Dr Bridge looked down at the Bookends. Between them sat a copy of a Pok\u00e9mon Red Version game kart, and the Official Pok\u00e9mon Red/Blue Strategy Guide. The mission says take it and leave\u2026 but he\u2019s so close to being the very best there ever was\u2026\n\nWelker pried the final doors open, and Bridge stepped inside. This room was much bigger on the inside, opening to the night sky; an actual stadium, a coliseum, stood before him, with one single figure under the lights.\n\"Hey! I was looking forward to seeing you, DJANGO! My rival should be strong to keep me sharp!\u201d\n\nQuietly, Bridge considered what the fastest route to victory would be.\n\n\u201c\u2026DJANGO!

Welker began to sing nursery rhymes as Charizard froze in brief terror. A shudder turned to a growl, and recoil turned to rage; Gary\u2019s starter launched a huge five-pointed star of fire at Welker, crashing the red beast like a truck.\nOn fire, the Welker leapt at the dragon, crunching down with a mouth full of lightning. Charizard returned with a slash, hewing a side of flesh right off Welker; the burning demon returned with a predatory bite to crush the skull. Charizard fell.\n\"NO! That can't be! You beat my best-\u201d\nBridge returned Welker and turned to leave, snatching up 826 before the ingame script made him hit the \u201cThe End\u201d screen.<hr/>Dr Bridge stepped out of the doorway, holding a belt of SCPok\u00e9balls and the Bookends. Two Agents rushed in, one throwing the belt into a high-security storage container and the other carefully placing the Bookends on a cart. Agent Lament stood off to one side, waiting for him.\n\u201cExcellent work, Doctor.\u201d Agent Lament shook his hand. \u201cYou did very well.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Lament. How were the nicknames?\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I gonna turn into a spider monster?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope!\u201d\n\nThey high-fived.<hr/>Later that night, Bridge sat back in his office, relaxing. Listening. Glancing at local security feeds on his desktop.\n\nHe quietly reached into his pocket, and placed a small, spherical object on his desk. Pressing a button, it grew to the size of an orange.\n\nFor you see\u2026 He did, indeed, have a hacked team. But nobody said he couldn\u2019t have a starter too.\n\n"
